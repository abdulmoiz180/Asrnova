This shift, moving from a centralized, intermediary-driven internet to a decentralized, user-centric ecosystem known as Web3, represents more than a mere technical update. It is a fundamental renegotiation of the power dynamics governing data, value, and identity. At the heart of this transformation lies blockchain technology, providing the infrastructure for trustless interactions, verifiable ownership, and autonomous digital economies. To comprehend the trajectory of this evolution, it is necessary to examine the historical context of the web, the systemic failures that necessitated its redesign, the technical mechanisms enabling decentralized repair, and the future societal implications of a fully integrated on-chain world."

Web 1.0, spanning from the early 1990s to approximately 2004, is defined as the \"Static Web\" or the \"Web of Information\". During this era, the internet functioned largely as a digital library. Websites were predominantly passive repositories of information, offering introductory text and basic hyperlinks with minimal interactivity. The technical foundation of this era rested upon HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), allowing for the retrieval of linked resources from across a fledgling global network. Users were consumers of content, provided by a limited number of publishers who maintained static servers."

This phase was defined by a frontend revolution that empowered users to become active creators rather than passive observers. Platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia democratized content production, enabling billions of people to share information, interact in real-time, and build digital communities. However, this newfound interactivity came at a hidden cost: the centralization of data. As the volume of user-generated content exploded, the infrastructure required to manage it became increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few technology giants. These entities emerged as \"gatekeepers,\" controlling the flow of information and monetizing user data through sophisticated advertising models."

This iteration is built upon core principles of decentralization, openness, and utility, leveraging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to create an internet that understands and interprets data on a level previously reserved for human cognition. Unlike the centralized servers of Web 2.0, Web 3.0 applications run on blockchains or decentralized peer-to-peer networks, ensuring that information is found based on its content rather than its location."
